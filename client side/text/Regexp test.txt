This example shows how the regular expression works. 

It will comment out everything after //

// e.g. this line will not be read

This will be read // but this will not

     It will strip out all empty lines and spaces        //this line has spaces at the beginning and the end

It can identify functions as below:

rect(0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2)

and get the function name and arguments.
