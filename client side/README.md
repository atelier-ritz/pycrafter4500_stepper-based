# Pycrafter4500
Python to control Texas Instrument Lightcrafter 4500 UV model

Unresolved bugs:

- the pyplot GUI freezes when you try to move it

- when the intervals between each command to the projector is too short, error occurs

- Don't support "+-*/" in variable assignment

- Allow functions without args

Features to be added:

- show * if there are changed to the file

- XY stage control?
